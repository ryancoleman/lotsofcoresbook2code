1) Licensing Copying and Distribution: 
=====================================
Please see the LICENSE file for the License.

2) Disclaimers: 
==============
This is research software and while every effort has been made to ensure it performs correctly it is not certified or warranted to be free of errors, bugs. Nor is it certified or warranted that it will not crash, hang or in other way malfunction. We likewise cannot and will not guarantee any specific performance on any specific system and use of this software is entirely at your own risk, as is disclaimed in the COPYRIGHT and LICENSE files. Further, some targets are experimental and incomplete. You have been warned.

3) Building the Code
====================
 i) Edit the Makefile
 ii) Replace the first line ('mode') to whichever target you are trying to generate code-for. e.g. for MIC set 

mode=mic

Available targets are:

 mic - Xeon Phi
 avx - Regular AVX 
 avx2 - AVX2 (e.g. for Haswell) -- untested
 sse  - For SSE -- untested
 scalar -- C, scalar code (SOALEN=1) -- some bugs known in multi-node code
 

iii) Run the code with 'make <target>' this will build the code generator and generate the code for the target.  The target specific code, will be placed in the subdirectory corresponding to the target (ie MIC code goes to mic/ AVX code goes to avx/ etc).

e.g. set mode=mic
followed by: make mic

The generated files will be dropped in the target directory, ie: 

 ./mic
 ./avx 
 
etc which will be created in the root directory if they don't yet exist.


4) How is the target configured?
================================

For each target there is a separate customMake.<target> which sets Makefile variables for the target. In addition some of these variables can be over-ridden on the command line to make (such as PRECISION, SOALEN, AVX2, ENABLE_LOW_PRECISION) as is done in the Makefile

Some env variables which affect the code generation are: 

PREF_L1_SPINOR_IN -- Generate L1 prefetches for input spinors
PREF_L2_SPINOR_IN -- Generate L2 prefetches for input spinors
PREF_L1_SPINOR_OUT -- Generate L1 prefetches for output spinors
PREF_L2_SPINOR_OUT -- Generate L2 prefetches for output spinors
PREF_L1_GAUGE -- Generate L1 prefetches for input gauge fields
PREF_L2_GAUGE -- Generate L2 prefetches for input gauge fields
PREF_L1_CLOVER -- Generate L1 prefetches for input clover terms
PREF_L2_CLOVER -- Generate L2 prefetches for in put clover terms

USE_LDUNPK   -- Use Load/Unpack as opposed to gather
USE_PKST     -- Use pack-store instead of scatter
USE_SHUFFLES -- Use loads & shuffles to transpose spinor when SOALEN > 4
NO_GPREF_L1  -- Generat a bunch of normal prefetches instead of gather prefetches for L1 
NO_GPREF_L2  -- Generate a bunch of normal prefetches instead of gather prefetches for L2 
ENABLE_STREAMING_STORES  -- Enable streaming stores for output spinor
USE_PACKED_GAUGES        -- Use 2D xy packing for Gauges -- enabled
USE_PACKED_CLOVER        --  Use 2D xy packing for Clover -- enabled

AVX2			 -- Generate AVX2 code (experimental)
AVX512		 -- together with mode=mic: Generate AVX512 code for Knight's Landing (untested)


5) How is the code organized
============================

There is two parts to the code: 
  a) The code generation framework. This works with addresses, registers and instructions. 
     Addresses are defined in address_types.h
     Instructions are defined in instructions.h 

   NB: Each instruction is an object, belonging to a class. 
   There are two kinds of instructions: those that have memory references and those that do not.
   Each instruction has a "serialize()" method which will print the code (potentially an intrinsic) 
   for that code.

   Then there are simple funcitons, which usually look like e.g.
 
	void loadFVec(InstVector& ivector, const FVec& ret, const Address *s, etc...)  {}

   These functions typically create an instruction object (In this case a load instruction), or
   several instruciton object, potentially making use of input references to 
   vectors and vectors. The created objects are inserted into the InstVector, which is just a 
   std::vector of Instruction* - s.

   By using functions like loadFVec, gatherFVec, scatterFVec etc, one can build linear streams
   of instructions. 

   The concrete bodies of the instructions, are implemented in the source files:

   inst_scalar.cc - Scalar C-code (VECLEN=1)

   inst_dp_vec2.cc - SSE Double Precision (VECLEN=2)
   inst_dp_vec4.cc - AVX Double Precision (VECLEN=4)
   inst_dp_vec8.cc - MIC (KNC/AVX512) Double Precision (VECLEN=8)

   inst_sp_vec4.cc - SSE Single Precision (VECLEN=4)
   inst_sp_vec8.cc - AVX Single Precision (VECLEN=8)
   inst_sp_vec16.cc - MIC (KNC/AVX512) Single Precision  (VECLEN=16)


b) The generators for the Kernels: 
  
   data_types.h -- defines data_types for Gauge fields, Spinors, and CloverTerm parts along with 
                   associated load, store, prefetch, stream etc functions (which use the Instruction objects)

  
   dslash.h  -- defines the code generator functions used to construct a dslash (projections, etc)
   dslash_common.h -- defines the main generator routines for things like projections, mat mults, face packs etc.
   dslash.cc -- implements the main kernels using dslash_common.h
   codegen.cc -- is the driver, that just calls generate_code() from dslash.cc


The various code-generation options in the inst_xx_vecX.cc files, the headers etc are controlled by compiler
#defines defined in the Makefiles, and customMakef.target files.
