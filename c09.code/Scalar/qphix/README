3) Getting Building and Installing this library:
================================================

The library is a C++ library and is mostly a collection of header files. This package also
contains some test programs.
	./t_dslash -- Test Wilson Dslash operator (against QDP++) 
        ./t_clov_dslash -- Test the Clover Dslash operators (against implementation outlined from Chroma)
        ./time_dslash_noqdp -- Time the Dslash operator, Wilson operator, and solvers,  without linkage to QDP++
        ./time_clov_noqdp -- Time the "Clover Dslash", Clover operator, and solver without linkage to QDP++

The installation and building of test programs is done using the GNU automake system. Configuration is performed 
with autoconf.  The Makefile.in-s are not checked into the repository and need to be regenerated.


a) Getting the library.
 --------------------

The library can be downloaded from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/JeffersonLab/qphix.git

b) Dependencies
---------------

 	*) The QDP++ library (http://usqcd-software.github.io/qdpxx/) -- to build the test programs
	*) Gnu Autoconf and Automake -- to regenerate the build system
        *) make -- to build and install
        *) Intel C++ Compiler ( Code tested with icpc (ICC) 14.0.1 20131008 )
        *) MPI for multi-node builds

        *) Intel MPI and CML Proxy for multi Xeon Phi running. Please contact Intel Parallel Computing Labs
           for CML Proxy source code.

NB: The code was tested with ICC 14.0.1 from  Intel Composer XE 2013 SP1.1.106. 
Some funnies were observed with the BLAS routines using ICC fom Composer XE 2015

Future compiler support is planned/ongoing. Please see TODO

c) Generating the build system
 -----------------------------

 *) Obtain the source code distribution, which should have a toplevel directory called qphix
 *) Regenerate the build system with commands: 
	 cd qphix
  	 autoreconf

d) Configuring the package.
 --------------------------

 The package has some components most of which can be selected with switches to configure:

   --prefix=<install_dir>  Install into directory <install_dir>
   --enable-clover         Enable Clover term related codes (default true)
   --enable-proc=PROC      Select kernels for processor PROC. Allowed values are SCALAR,AVX,MIC for now	
   --with-qmp<qmp_dir>     QMP Library is in <qmp_dir>
   --with-qdp=<qdpxx_dir>  QDP++ library is in <qdpxx_dir>
   --enable-soalen=SOA     Set the SOA-length to SOA (SOA=4,8,16 as appropriate) 
   --enable-cean           Enable C++ Extended Array Notation (Cilk++ notation) in some places (default: disabled)
   --enable-mm-malloc      Use mm_malloc for allocating aligned arrays 
                           if disabled posix_memalign will be used. 
			   Currently Xeon Phi will use a mixture of mmap and _mm_malloc irrespective of this value (default: enabled)

    
    In addition, Compiler flags can be passed via variables
    CXXFLAGS, CFLAGS and teh compiler can be selected via vriables  CXX and CC	

    When compiling for Xeon Phi in native mode or cross compiling in general it is useful
    to switch autoconf into cross compile mode. This can be achieved by giving a different value
    for --host and --build e.g. for Xeon Phi: --host=x86_64-linux-gnu --build=none-none-none
E.g: 

       For AVX: 

	configure --prefix=<install_location> \
	          --with-qdp=<QDP++ installation>
                  --enable-proc=AVX \
                  --enable-soalen=8 \
                  --enable-clover \
	   	  --enable-openmp \
		  --enable-cean \
                  --enable-mm-malloc \
                  CXXFLAGS="-openmp -g -O2 -finline-functions -fno-alias -std=c++11 -xAVX -vec-report -restrict" \
	          CFLAGS="-openmp -g  -O2 -fno-alias -std=c99 -xAVX -vec-report -restrict" \
                  CXX="mpiicpc" \
                  CC="mpiicc"

  or for MIC: 

	 configure --prefix=<install_location> \
                  --with-qdp=<QDP++ installation>
                  --enable-proc=MIC \
                  --enable-soalen=8 \
                  --enable-clover \ 
                  --enable-openmp \
		  --enable-cean \
		  --enable-mm-malloc \
                  CXXFLAGS="-openmp -mmic -vec-report -restrict -mGLOB_default_function_attrs=\"use_gather_scatter_hint=off\" -g -O2 -finline-functions -fno-alias -std=c++0x" \
                  CFLAGS="-mmic -vec-report -restrict -mGLOB_default_function_attrs=\"use_gather_scatter_hint=off\" -openmp -g  -O2 -fno-alias -std=c9l9
                  CXX="mpiicpc" \
                  CC="mpiicc" \
		  --host=x86_64-linux-gnu --build=none-none-none

In addition it has been found that GCC and Clang don't like the restrict keyword in C++ source, but allow defining the __restrict__ extension
So you may need to add -Drestrict=__restrict__ to CXXFLAGS


e) Building And Installing
---------------------------
 Once configured the package can be installed using "make; make install" 
 the test programs are build in the <install_dir>/tests/ directory and are installed in the <install_dir>/bin/ directory
 Since the test programs may check double precision solves as well it is recommended to build with a double precision build of QDP++

f) Running the test programs

 The test programs need the following typical command line parameters:

   -x Lx -y Ly -z Lz -t Lt    -- the dimensions of the lattice
  -by By -bz Bz               -- (By x Bz) block size parameters: 4x4 for MIC, 8x8 for Sandy Bridge work well
  -pxy Pxy -pxyz Pxyz         -- padding factors Pxy Pxyz, Can be set to zero, Pxy=1 may gain a little for particular lattices (e.g 32^3x64)
  -c Cores                    -- Number of cores (all the cores in a system): e.g. 59 for Xeon Phi 5110P, 60 for Xeon Phi 7120, 16 for a dual socket 8 core  per socket Xeon 
  -sy Sy -sz Sz               -- SMT thread configuration (Sy=1, Sz=4 works well on Knights Corner, Sy=1, Sz=2 works well on Xeon)
  -minct  Ct                  -- Minimum number of blocks in time. This should be the number of sockets ideally.
  -compress12                 -- Employ two row compression (12 number compression)

For timing routines one can also set: -i <iters>   Number of timing iters to perform.
For multi-node running one can add: -geom Px Py Pz Pt to specify a (Px Py Pz Pt) virtual node geometry. 
  NB: Cores refers to the number of cores per node.

Some tests may occationally support:

 -prec=PRECISION              -- precision to work in h=half, f=single, d=double

E.g. a typical clover dslash test on a dual socket 8 core-per-socket Xeon System would go like:

 ./t_clov_dslash -x 32 -y 32 -z 32 -t 64 -by 8 -bz 8 -pxy 1 -pxyz 0 -c 16 -sy 1 -sz 2 -minct 2 -compress12 -geom 1 1 1 1 -i 500

Whereas on a Xeon Phi 7120 it would be

./t_clov_dslash -x 32 -y 32 -z 32 -t 64 -by 4 -bz 4 -pxy 1 -pxyz 0 -c 60 -sy 1 -sz 4 -minct 1 -compress12 -geom 1 1 1 1 -i 500

4) Integration with Chroma. 
===========================

  a) Minimum Chroma Revision:
 ----------------------------
  The minimum revision for using this library with Chroma is Git Commit ID:  

   e558743151ff30598b3d0e374b2ccb6fe95a5fbc

  from the Chroma distribution on GitHub: https://github.com/JeffersonLab/chroma.git

  b) Configuring Chroma for building with QPhiX 
  ----------------------------------------------
 	QPhiX has been integrated with chroma as a LinOpSysSolver. To use the following configure options neeed to be passed to Chroma
   
       --with-qphix-solver=<QPhiX Install directory >      - specify the location of the installed QPhiX library
        --enable-qphix-solver-arch=PROC                    - specify the QPhiX processor architecture (avx,mic)
        --enable-qphix-solver-soalen=SOA                   - the SOA Length for the problem (4,8,16 etc as appropriate)
        --enable-qphix-solver-compress12                   - add this option if 12 compression is required
        --enable-qphix-solver-inner-type=f                 - precision of the inner solver for mixed prec: (h=half, f=single, d=double)
        --enable-qphix-solver-inner-soalen=4               - SOA length of inner solver

  c) XML Drivers; 
  -------------

    The XML tag group to use the lin op solver in Propagator applications looks like this for non-mixed precision solvers:

       <InvertParam>
          <invType>QPHIX_CLOVER_INVERTER</invType>
          <SolverType>BICGSTAB</SolverType>

            </AnisoParam>
          </CloverParams>
          <AntiPeriodicT>false</AntiPeriodicT>    <!-- set to true if BCs are antiperiodic -->
          <Verbose>false</Verbose>
          <NCores>16</NCores>                     <!-- number of cores per node -->
          <ThreadsPerCore>2</ThreadsPerCore>      <!-- number of threads per core -->
          <By>8</By>				  <!-- By and Bz block dimensions -->
          <Bz>8</Bz>
          <Sy>1</Sy>                              <!-- Sy and Sz hyperthread grid dimensions -->

          <MinCt>2</MinCt>                             <!-- Ct at start -- no of temporal blocks. Set equal to no of sockets -->
          <RsdToleranceFactor>5.0</RsdToleranceFactor> <!-- tolerate slack between iterated and true residua, e,g, due to preconditioning etc -->
          <Tune>true</Tune>                            <!-- tune BLAS routines prior to solve -->
        </InvertParam>


For the Iterative Refinement solver the XML is similar:

	<InvertParam>
          <invType>QPHIX_CLOVER_ITER_REFINE_BICGSTAB_INVERTER</invType>
          <SolverType>BICGSTAB</SolverType>  <!-- Inner solver -->
          <MaxIter>1000</MaxIter>	     <!-- Max outer iters -->
          <RsdTarget>1.0e-7</RsdTarget>      <!-- Target relative residuum for outer solver -->
          <Delta>0.1</Delta>		     <!-- Relative residuum drop factor in inner solve. Ie inner solve reduces residuum this much -->
          <CloverParams>		     <!-- Action params same as in FermionAction -->
            <Kappa>0.115</Kappa>
            <clovCoeff>2.0171</clovCoeff>
            <clovCoeffR>2.0171</clovCoeffR>

            <AnisoParam>
              <anisoP>true</anisoP>
              <t_dir>3</t_dir>
              <xi_0>2.9</xi_0>
              <nu>0.94</nu>
            </AnisoParam>
          </CloverParams>

        </InvertParam>

g) General pointers about the code...
-------------------------------------

 - this is a C++ code and uses templates
 - The code parameters Floating point type, Vector length, SOA length, and a boolean to indicate 12 compression are typically template parameters e.g.

	 Geometry<FT,V,S,compress12>
         Dslash<FT,V,S,compress12> etc...

 -  These parameters typically relate to types or array dimensions and hence need to be set at compile time. This is annoying (especially for the compression)
 but there it is.

 - The Geometry<FT,V,S,compress> class defines the node geometry, blocking, padding etc. It also supplies allocation functions for gauges, spinors, and clover terms.
 - The Comm<FT,V,S,compress> class defines multi-node communications.

 -- Code generated by QPhiX codegen is copied to the directory: 
          qphix/include/qphix/mic/generated  - for MIC
          qphix/include/qphix/avx/generated  - for AVX

 The kernels in the generated directories are included with a combination of:
         qphix/include/qphix/<ARCH>/xxxx_complete_specialization_form.h 
   and   qphix/include/qphix/<ARCH>/xxxx_complete_specialization.h 

where ARCH=mic or ARCH=avx 
and xxx is dslash_ARCH or clov_dslash_ARCH ie: dslash_avx clov_dslash_avx 

The dslash site loops and communications are defined in the functions 
   DyzPlus - Dslash
   DyzMinus- Dslash Dagger 
etc in the files:

qphix/include/dslash_body.h and qphix/include/clover_dslash_body.h

-- Blas linear algebra is implemented by combining site loops which loop over the SOA-s in a vector 
   with Functors to be executed on the vector. The loops are defined in qphix/include/qphix/site_loops.h
   and the various functors are defined in qphix/include/real_functors.h qphix/include/complex_functors.h 
    

-- Solvers are currently implemnented in
	 invcg.h -- Conjugate Gradients:   solves M^\dagger M x = b
         invbicgstab.h -- BICGStab :       solves M x = b 
         inv_richardson_multiprec.h -- Solves M x = b using iterative refinement (aka defect correction).

Please see the source code in the tests/ directory on how to set these up:

e.g. in  tests/testDslashFull.cc 

The Dslash operators themselves provide two main operations:
      
     y = D x            (or  y = A^{-1} D x)  -- called Dslash
     z = a x - b D y    (or  z = A x - b D y) -- so called  'achimbdpsi' versions -- a,b are constants, A is the clover term)

From this one can easily construct the Schur preconditioned operators: 
e.g. y = (A - D A^{-1} D) x
is constructed as  z = A^{-1}D x,  y = Ax - bDz
