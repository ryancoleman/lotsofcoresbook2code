Dimer method
============

.. module:: ase.dimer

The dimer method is a means of finding a saddle point on a potential energy
surface starting from a single point (as opposed to a NEB calculation,
which requires an initial and final state). You can read about this method
here:

1. 'A dimer method for finding saddle points on high dimensional
   potential surfaces using only first derivatives', G. Henkelman 
   and H. Jonsson, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7010, 1999.

An example is shown below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../ase/test/dimer_method.py
    :end-before: Test

The module contains several classes.

.. autoclass:: DimerControl
.. autoclass:: MinModeAtoms
.. autoclass:: MinModeTranslate
.. autoclass:: DimerEigenmodeSearch
