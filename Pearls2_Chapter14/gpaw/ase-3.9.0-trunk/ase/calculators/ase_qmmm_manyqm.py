"""QM/MM interface with QM=FHI-aims, MM=gromacs

QM could be something else, but you need to read in qm-atom charges
from the qm program (in method 'get_qm_charges') 


One can have many QM regions, each with a different calculator.
There can be only one MM calculator, which is calculating the whole
system. 


Non-bonded interactions:
------------------------
Generally:

Within the same QM-QM:
  by qm calculator
MM-MM:
  by MM calculator
QM-MM:
  by MM using MM vdw parameters and QM charges.
Different QM different QM: 
  by MM using QM and MM charges and MM-vdw parameters

The Hirschfeld charges (or other atomic charges) 
on QM atoms are calculated by QM in a H terminated cluster in vacuum. 
The charge of QM atom next to MM atom (edge-QM-atom) 
and its H neighbors are set as in the classical force field. 
The extra(missing) charge results from: 

1) linkH atoms
2) The edge-QM atoms, and their qm-H neighbors, 
   have their original MM charges.
3) and the fact that the charge of the QM fraction 
   is not usually an integer when using the original MM charges.
   It is added equally to all QM atoms 
   (not being linkH and not being edge-QM-atom or its H neighbor)
   so that the total charge of the MM-fragment involving QM atoms
   will be the same as in the original MM-description.

Vdw interactions are calculated by MM-gromacs for MM and MM-QM inteactions.
The QM-QM vdw interaction s could be done by the FHI-aims if desired
(by modifying the imput for QM-FHI-aims input accordingly.

Bonded interactions::

  E= 
  E_qm(QM-H)         ; qm energy of H terminated QM cluster(s) 
  + E_mm(ALL ATOMS)  ; mm energy of all atoms,
                     ; except for terms in which all MM-interacting atoms are 
                     ; in the same QM region

Forces do not act on link atoms but they are positioned by scaling.
Forces on link atoms are given to their QM and MM neighbors by chain rule.
(see J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011, 7, 761-777).
The optimal edge-qm-atom-linkH bond length is calculated 
by QM in 'get_eq_qm_atom_link_h_distances'
or they are read from a file.


Questions & Comments markus.kaukonen@iki.fi

I'm especially interested in cases when we need two or more 
QM regions. For instance two redox centers in a protein, 
cathode and anode of a fuel cell ... you name it!


Some things to improve:

1) Water topology issue (at the moment water cannot be in QM),
   Its topology should be put into the main 
   topology file, not in a separate file.

2) point charges and periodicity (if desired) to the QM calculation
   (now in vacuum)

3) Eichinger type of link atom treatment with fitted force constants for 
   linkH-QMedge (bond strecth)
   linkH-QMedge-QMnextTOedge (angle terms)

4) file io using unformatted formats (.trr) instead of g96
   This is not easily possible without loading extra stuff from
   ftp://ftp.gromacs.org/pub/contrib/xd...e-1.1.1.tar.gz.

5) Utilize gromacs-python wrapper: (just found this today 31.12.2012...)
