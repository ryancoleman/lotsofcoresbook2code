	of the method in a form suitable for accepting the input electronic
	structure from USPP plane-wave DFT simulations. We apply the method
	to the calculation of Wannier functions, dipole moments and spontaneous
	polarizations for a range of test cases. A comparison with norm-conserving
	pseudopotentials is reported as a benchmark.},

  abstract = {The formal relationship between ultrasoft (US) Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials
	and Blöchl's projector augmented wave (PAW) method is derived. It
	is shown that the total energy functional for US pseudopotentials
	can be obtained by linearization of two terms in a slightly modified
	PAW total energy functional. The Hamilton operator, the forces, and
	the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A
	simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes
	supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical
	tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the
	PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron
	methods. These tests include small molecules (H2, H2O, Li2, N2, F2,
	BF3, SiF4) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, CaF2,
	Fe, Co, Ni). Particular attention is paid to the bulk properties

  journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},

  volume = {21},
  pages = {084204 (7pp)},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {A computational method for partitioning a charge density grid into
	Bader volumes is presented which is efficient, robust, and scales
	linearly with the number of grid points. The partitioning algorithm
	follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient
	from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached.
	In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths
	can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement
	maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the
	algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be
	aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid
	points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated
	when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based
	approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for
	the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density
	functional theory calculations.},

  number = {12},
  month = sep,
  abstract = {We have developed a practical scheme to construct partly occupied,
	maximally localized Wannier functions (WFs) for a wide range of systems.
	We explain and demonstrate how the inclusion of selected unoccupied
	states in the definition of the WFs can improve both their localization
	and symmetry properties. A systematic selection of the relevant unoccupied
	states is achieved by minimizing the spread of the resulting WFs.
	The method is applied to a silicon cluster, a copper crystal, and
	a Cu(100) surface with nitrogen adsorbed. In all cases we demonstrate
	the existence of a set of WFs with particularly good localization
	and symmetry properties, and we show that this set of WFs is characterized
	by a maximal average localization.}
